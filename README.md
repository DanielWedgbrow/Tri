#Tri

**My first attempt at making a game.  It's a top down space shooter.**

You can play it [here](http://198.211.105.87/tri/)

Developed using [Phaser.js](http://phaser.io)

*  Background was made in Gimp.
*  Sprites were done in Pixelmator and sprite sheets were generated using [Shoebox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/).
*  All the sound effects were done using [bfxr](http://bfxr.net).
